The TanyaNotaris app is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies using either the npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Second, just run the development server to try the app:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

All the pages, components, configs, constants, hook, etc. are located within the `src` folder, and please just modify only in that folder (if you just want to change the view of the app, not the config). But, if you want to modify the current configuration of this nextjs project, they're located in `next.config.js`.

**The current project is client side rendering only!**
